"""
Restaurant Order System - Hexagonal Architecture Demo

This application demonstrates the hexagonal architecture pattern with:
- Domain entities (business logic)
- Ports (interfaces)
- Adapters (implementations)
- Application services (use cases)
- Console interface (user adapter)

The core business logic is completely isolated from external concerns.
