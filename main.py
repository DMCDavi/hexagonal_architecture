Restaurant Order System - Clean Hexagonal Architecture Demo

This application demonstrates the Clean Hexagonal Architecture pattern with:
- Domain Layer: Pure business logic (entities, value objects)
- Application Layer: Use cases and ports (interfaces)
- Infrastructure Layer: Adapters and external concerns

The architecture follows the dependency rule: dependencies point inward.
The core business logic is completely isolated from external concerns.
